This project analyzes pre-clinical data from animal studies for the effect of different potential drug treatments for the squamous cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. 
Data is a compilation of observarions of cancer lessions on mice and subsequent 45 day treatment comparing  Capomulin with other drugs such as Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, or Placebo. 

The scrip uses python Pandas and 
The analysis consist in generating statistical analysis and several plots using both Panda's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib pyplot. 
Data analysis is a powerful tool to look at the data with more objective lenses but choosing the correct variable is even more  important. 
Moreover, this "preclinical data" if real, has to be taken as a observations in animal studies that may not translate to humans.

Data observations and Insights.

Only two drugs showed reduction of tumor size, Capomulin and Ramicane.

Capomulin seems to be as effective as Ramicane at treating the tumors in this population of mice. It seems to be effectively reducing the tumor volume over the 45 days of treatment in this specific mice cohort.

Some of the drug treatments such as Ketapril seem less effective than no treatment , i.e. placebo. Other parameters such as survival rate and metastasis need to be assessed to confirm the negative effect of Katapril in this mice population.

Many other drugs are similar than no treatment, in those casees a carefulconsideration of the survival rate and the metastasis will help guide better conclusions regarding effectiveness.

Overall, this data on treatment effect in mice provide some guidance, however data on patients will definitively help to shine some ligth on the real effectiveness of these treatments.
